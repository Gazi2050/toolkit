# Free Tools Website

A **lightweight web platform** providing **free, no-signup tools** for all users. Some tools integrate **AI** for enhanced functionality.  
The full stack is built with **Svelte** using **TypeScript**, **ShadCN-Svelte**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
All backend logic is handled within Svelte itself — **no separate backend** is required.
